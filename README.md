# Sprint Assignment 1

## Important information:

### Adding your DB credentials:

There is a file included called "db-creds-TEMPLATE.json". Make a copy of this file named "db-creds.json". Then add your credentials to this new file only. 
**DO NOT ADD THEM TO THE TEMPLATE FILE!** If you do this exactly right, the ".gitignore" file will keep git from tracking it, so you don't have to worry about 
accidentally adding it with a "git add ." command.

**NOTE:** I've updated the gitignore pattern, so as long as you keep your file named "db-creds.json", it should be safe to put it in any directory.

## Backlog:

- improve directory structure
- add book search results page
- move contact results page to book search results page
- make search page search across all book info fields (title, author, isbn)
- add code to capture contact form data and store in database
- add code to populate html results
- add code to interface with db credentials (remember: do NOT track the credentials file)

## Note:

The notebook with the hard-copy of this list is currently missing, so this list may not be complete.
